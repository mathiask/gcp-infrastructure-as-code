A small Debian machine to run moodle and docker moodle in.

It currently only installs docker and enables the users "mathias" and
"paola" to access it directly. The actual Moodle setup is an exercise.

Contents:
- create.sh: create an instance with name $1
- startup.sh: the startup script run in the new instance
